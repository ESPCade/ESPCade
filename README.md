# ESPCade

We may all be stuck at home, but that doesn't mean we can't have some fun with friends on our arduino boards!! With our project, you can play your favourite classics with your new friends from 6.08 ðŸ¥°, and compete to be at the top of the leaderboard! Who needs animal crossing when you've got pong, hangman and pictionary all in one place anyways?? (Surprise memes included ðŸ˜‰ðŸ¤¯)
